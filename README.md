▶ Description
  - Items considered personally identifiable information (PII) in medical data include name, unique identification number, address, age, date and time information, names of other hospitals, and sensitive diagnoses. By analyzing real-world medical records, we identified the expressions in which these items appear and defined regular expressions accordingly, allowing labels to be applied to detected information.
  - Additionally, we implemented various functions to analyze text data from multiple angles, such as label verification in labeled files, string search with regular expressions, extraction of specific columns, and file comparison.
